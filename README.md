# The Final Project
for CS50's Introduction to Databases with SQL <br>
by Akbar Gafurov

## Description

For my final project in *CS50â€™s Introduction to Databases with SQL* course, I designed and implemented an extensive database schema for a project titled *Constellations*. Using MySQL, I constructured four relational tables to efficiently and effectively organize and store constellation data. To improve performance and streamline rapid information retrieval, I developed three sample views and implemented four indexes for optimized query operations. 

The project is fully documented, with through explanations of the database structure and usage, alongisde a visual schema diagram created using *Mermaid.js*. This project not only showcases my proficiency in designing and optimizing SQL databases but also reflects my strong attention to detail and organization skills.
